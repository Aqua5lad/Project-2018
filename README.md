# Project-2018
## Purpose of this Repository
This repository is to manage the Spring Project 2018, which draws on the python programming skills covered in the 1st semester of the GMIT Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course.

## Subject of the Project
The subject matter of the project concerns the well-known [Fisherâ€™s Iris data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris). Specifically, to research the data set, then write documentation and code in the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org) based on that research.

Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics)</sup> introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems"<sup>[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x)</sup> as an example of linear discriminant analysis<sup>[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis)</sup>.

This data set recorded the species of each Iris (3 were identified), and the measurement of 4 variables on each flower. These variables were the sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width (in centimetres). It was performed on 50 flowers, from each of 3 species of Iris, resulting in a total of 750 observations.

## Investigation of the Problem
A python program called NumpyData was written to analyse the dataset and identify the maximum, minimum and mean values of the iris measurements. The results of this analysis are shown in the following table.

              | sepal length | sepal width  | petal length | petal width
------------- | -------------| -------------| -------------| -------------
              |              |              |              |       
Maximum (cm)  |     7.9      |      4.4     |     6.9      |      2.5    
Minimum (cm)  |     4.3      |      2.0     |     1.0      |      0.1   
Mean    (cm)  |     5.843    |      3.054   |     3.759    |      1.199    

No. measured  |     50       |      50      |     50       |      50
